## 1. Secure Spending of Assets

Our rigorous testing suite demonstrates the contract's ability to manage secure
asset spending effectively.

### Detailed Test Analysis

#### A. Test Case: Successful Transaction (success_sign)

```
   Testing ...

    ┍━ multisig ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    │ PASS [mem: 589296, cpu: 274524061] success_sign
    │ · with traces
    │ | Test: Successful Transaction Signing
    │ | Total number of signatories in the multisig
    │ | 4
    │ | Required threshold of signatures
    │ | 3
    │ | Number of signatories actually signing this transaction
    │ | 3
    │ | Total amount in the contract (in lovelace)
    │ | 100000000000
    │ | Maximum spending limit per transaction (in lovelace)
    │ | 1000000000
    │ | Amount being withdrawn in this transaction (in lovelace)
    │ | 1000000000
    │ | Remaining amount in the contract after withdrawal (in lovelace)
    │ | 99000000000
    │ | Result: Transaction successfully signed and executed!
    ┕━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 1 tests | 1 passed | 0 failed
```

This test validates the contract's ability to execute transactions when properly
authorized. It demonstrates a successful transaction where:

- 3 out of 4 signatories approved the transaction (meeting the threshold)
- The withdrawal amount (1,000,000,000) was within the spending limit
- The contract balance was correctly updated after the transaction

The test confirms that the contract correctly processes transactions when the
required number of signatories (3 out of 4) approve and the withdrawal amount is
within the specified limit.

#### B. Test Case: Rejected Insufficient Signatures (reject_insufficient_signatures)

```
     Testing ...

    ┍━ multisig ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    │ PASS [mem: 410732, cpu: 207334934] reject_insufficient_signatures
    │ · with traces
    │ | Test: Rejecting Transaction with Insufficient Signatures
    │ | Total number of signatories in the multisig
    │ | 4
    │ | Required threshold of signatures
    │ | 3
    │ | Number of signatories actually signing this transaction
    │ | 2
    │ | Total amount in the contract (in lovelace)
    │ | 100000000000
    │ | Maximum spending limit per transaction (in lovelace)
    │ | 1000000000
    │ | Attempted withdrawal amount (in lovelace)
    │ | 1000000000
    │ | Contract amount if withdrawal were allowed (in lovelace)
    │ | 99000000000
    │ | Result: Transaction rejected due to insufficient signatures!
    │ | signed_within_threshold ? False
    ┕━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 1 tests | 1 passed | 0 failed
```

This test demonstrates the contract's robust security measures by successfully
rejecting a transaction with insufficient signatures (2 provided, 3 required),
thereby protecting assets from unauthorized spending.

## 2. Seamless Adjustment of Signer Thresholds

The contract incorporates a user-friendly process for adjusting signer
thresholds, ensuring adaptability to changing security needs.

### Detailed Test Analysis

#### Test Case: Successful Threshold Adjustment (success_adjust_threshold)

```
     Testing ...

    ┍━ multisig ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    │ PASS [mem: 640878, cpu: 267881842] success_adjust_threshold
    │ · with traces
    │ | Test: Successfully Adjusting Signature Threshold
    │ | Original signature threshold
    │ | 2
    │ | Total number of signatories in the multisig
    │ | 4
    │ | Current contract value (in lovelace)
    │ | {_ h'': {_ h'': 100000000000 } }
    │ | User clicks on action Redeemer: Update
    │ | 122([])
    │ | New threshold value
    │ | 3
    │ | Number of signatories approving this change
    │ | 4
    │ | Contract value after threshold adjustment (should be unchanged)
    │ | {_ h'': {_ h'': 100000000000 } }
    │ | Result: Signature threshold successfully updated!
    ┕━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 1 tests | 1 passed | 0 failed

      Summary 1 check, 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

This test verifies the contract's ability to adjust the signer threshold from 2
to 3 without errors, demonstrating the flexibility of the contract's security
parameters.

### Threshold Adjustment Workflow

1. **Initiate Threshold Change:** Users can propose new threshold values through
   an intuitive interface.
2. **Review Proposed Changes:** The system clearly presents current and proposed
   thresholds for easy comparison.
3. **Collect Required Signatures:**Authorized signers can efficiently review and
   sign the proposal.
4. **Confirmation of Update:** Upon collecting required signatures, the system
   promptly updates the threshold.

This streamlined process ensures that threshold adjustments are both secure and
user-friendly.

## 3. Dynamic Addition or Removal of Signers

The contract allows for flexible management of the signer pool, adapting to
organizational changes while maintaining security.

### Detailed Test Analysis

#### Test Case: Successful Signer Addition (success_add_signer)

```
   Testing ...

    ┍━ multisig ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    │ PASS [mem: 596818, cpu: 258625029] success_add_signer
    │ · with traces
    │ | Test: Successfully Adding a New Signer to the Multisig Contract
    │ | Number of signatories before addition
    │ | 4
    │ | Current contract value (in lovelace)
    │ | 100000000000
    │ | Current signature threshold
    │ | 3
    │ | Number of signatories approving this change
    │ | 4
    │ | Redeemer used for this operation
    │ | 122([])
    │ | Number of signatories after addition
    │ | 5
    │ | Signature threshold after addition (unchanged)
    │ | 3
    │ | Contract value after adding signer (should be unchanged)
    │ | 100000000000
    │ | Result: New signer successfully added to the multisig!
    ┕━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 1 tests | 1 passed | 0 failed
```

This test confirms the contract's ability to dynamically add a new signer,
increasing the total number of signatories from 4 to 5.

### Dynamic Signer Addition Process

1. **Proposal Initiation**: An authorized user proposes a new signer, providing
   necessary credentials.
2. **Collective Review**: Existing signers examine the proposal details.
3. **Approval Gathering**: The system collects required signatures for the
   addition.
4. **Execution and Verification**: Upon approval, the new signer is added, and
   the updated list is displayed for confirmation.

#### Test Case: Successful Signer Removal (success_remove_signer)

```
    Testing ...

    ┍━ multisig ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    │ PASS [mem: 525925, cpu: 233410760] success_remove_signer
    │ · with traces
    │ | Test: Successfully Removing a Signer from the Multisig Contract
    │ | Current contract value (in lovelace)
    │ | 100000000000
    │ | Number of signatories before removal
    │ | 4
    │ | Signature threshold before removal
    │ | 3
    │ | Number of signatories approving this change
    │ | 4
    │ | Redeemer used for this operation
    │ | 122([])
    │ | Number of signatories after removal
    │ | 3
    │ | Signature threshold after removal and adjustment (Can be changed)
    │ | 2
    │ | Contract value after removing signer (should be unchanged)
    │ | 100000000000
    │ | Result: Signer successfully removed and threshold adjusted
    ┕━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 1 tests | 1 passed | 0 failed
```

This test verifies the contract's capability to remove signers and automatically
adjust the threshold, demonstrating its adaptability to changing organizational
needs while maintaining security.

### Dynamic Signer Removal Process

1. **Removal Proposal**: An authorized user initiates the removal of a specific
   signer.
2. **Proposal Review**: Remaining signers assess the removal proposal.
3. **Consensus Building**: The system gathers necessary approvals, excluding the
   signer in question.
4. **Execution and Confirmation**: Post-approval, the signer is removed, and the
   system displays the updated list for verification.

### Security Considerations

- The contract maintains a minimum signer threshold to prevent security
  vulnerabilities.
- Threshold adjustments may be required before certain signer removals to
  maintain contract integrity.

## Conclusion

The Upgradable Multisignature Smart Contract demonstrates robust security,
flexibility, and user-centric design. Through comprehensive testing and
thoughtful process implementation, it effectively manages secure asset spending,
allows for seamless threshold adjustments, and facilitates dynamic signer
management.

These features collectively ensure that the contract can adapt to evolving
organizational needs while maintaining the highest standards of security and
usability.
