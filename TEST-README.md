# Upgradable Multi-signature Smart Contract: Test Documentation

## Overview

   This document presents comprehensive evidence of the successful implementation
   and testing of the Upgradable Multi-signature Smart Contract. It addresses three
   key aspects:

   1. **Secure Spending of Assets**

   2. **Seamless Adjustment of Signer Thresholds**
   3. **Dynamic Addition or Removal of Signers**

   The contract undergoes rigorous property-based testing using Aiken’s fuzz framework, where over 1,100 randomized test cases ensure robustness and resilience under varied scenarios.

## Test Suite Overview

   The test suite comprises **eleven key test cases**, split between:

   - **Happy Path Tests (6 cases)**: Verify expected, valid operations.

   - **Negative Tests (5 cases)**: Confirm the contract correctly rejects invalid operations.

   Each test case executes **100 iterations** (fuzzy tests) with randomized inputs, and many tests can be reproduced deterministically via a seed (e.g., --seed=2209211554).

### Test Execution Results

   Reproducing an individual test is straightforward:

   ```sh
   upgradable-multisig$ aiken check -m fail_end_multisig_fuzzy
      ...
      ┕ with --seed=2209211554 → 1 tests | 1 passed | 0 failed
   ```

   **1. Secure Spending of Assets**

   Our rigorous testing suite demonstrates the contract's ability to manage secure asset spending effectively, starting with the initiating / creation of a multisig

### Detailed Test Analysis

#### A. Test Case: validate_init (succeed_init_multisig_fuzzy)

   ![init-multisig.png](/docs/images/init-multisig.png)

   - Objective: Validate that the multisig contract initializes correctly.
   - Key Points:

      - Correct datum per design specification.

      - All required signers must authorize the initialization.

   - Iterations: 100 tests.


#### B.  Transaction Authorization (Signing): validate_sign

   This test validates the contract's ability to execute transactions when properly
   authorized. It demonstrates a successful transaction where:

   - Signatories approved the transaction (meeting the threshold)

   - The withdrawal amount was within the spending limit
   - The contract balance was correctly updated after the transaction

   There are three main tests each with 100 different checks within this endpoint:

   1. **Locking Funds** 

      **Test Case:** ```succeed_sign_lock_multisig_fuzzy```

      ![succeed_sign_lock_multisig_fuzzy.png](/docs/images/succeed_sign_lock_multisig_fuzzy.png)

      - Objective: Confirm that funds remain locked until the required number of signatories approve.
      
      - Iterations: 100 tests.

   1. **Unlocking Funds**
   
      **Test Case:** ```succeed_sign_unlock_multisig_fuzzy```

      ![succeed_sign_unlock_multisig_fuzzy.png](/docs/images/succeed_sign_unlock_multisig_fuzzy.png)

      - Objective: Verify that funds can be unlocked when the threshold of signatures is met and withdrawal limits are respected.
      
      - Iterations: 100 tests.

   1. **Failure on Insufficient Authorization** 
   
      **Test Case:** fail_sign_multisig_fuzzy

      ![fail_sign_multisig_fuzzy.png](/docs/images/fail_sign_multisig_fuzzy.png)

      - Objective: Ensure transactions are rejected when signer thresholds aren’t met, protecting against unauthorized spending.

      - Scenarios Covered:
         - Insufficient signer approvals.

         - Malformed or invalid signer inputs.
         - Withdrawal amounts exceeding limits.
      - Iterations: 100 tests.

### Acceptance Criteria

   **Objective**: Ensure only authorized members execute asset transactions.  

   | Test Case | Description | Relevance |  
   |-----------|-------------|-----------|  
   | `succeed_sign_unlock_multisig_fuzzy` | Unlocks and executes transactions when authorized signers meet the threshold. | Validates secure spending under valid conditions. |  
   | `succeed_sign_lock_multisig_fuzzy` | Locks funds until the required threshold of signatures is achieved. | Ensures security rules are enforced. |  
   | `fail_sign_multisig_fuzzy` | Rejects transactions with invalid/insufficient signatures (e.g., unauthorized signers, incomplete quorum). | Prevents unauthorized access and potential misuse. |  

   **Summary**:  
   - **100% pass rate** across 100 fuzzy iterations for both valid and invalid scenarios.  

   - Fuzz testing simulates adversarial inputs (e.g., malformed signatures, mismatched keys) to stress-test edge cases.

## 2. Contract Updates and Signer Adjustments (validate_update)

   The two tests below demonstrate a user-friendly process for verifying the:  

   - Adjusting signer thresholds, ensuring adaptability to changing security needs.
   
   - Dynamic addition and removal of signers allowing for flexible management of the signer pool, adapting to organizational changes while maintaining security.
   - Secure spending limit adjustment

   1. **Successful Update**

      **Test Case: ```succeed_update_multisig_fuzzy```**

      ![succeed_update_multisig_fuzzy.png](/docs/images/succeed_update_multisig_fuzzy.png)

      - Objective: Confirm that authorized signers can adjust thresholds, add, or remove signers.

      - Key Points:
         - Adjustments are only executed when a valid proposal is signed by all required signers.

         - Uses randomized threshold values to validate robustness.
      - Iterations: 100 tests.

   1. **Failure on Unauthorized Update**

      ![fail_update_multisig_fuzzy.png](/docs/images/fail_update_multisig_fuzzy.png)

   - Objective: Ensure that updates are rejected if the signer does not have proper authority.
   
   - Iterations: 100 tests.


### Update Workflow

1. **Initiate Change:** Through an intuitive interface, Signers can: 

   - Propose new threshold values or new signers.

   - Propose removal of an existing signer.

2. **Review Proposed Changes:** The system clearly presents current and proposed
   changes for easy comparison.
3. **Collect Required Signatures:** Authorized signers can efficiently review and
   sign the proposal.
4. **Confirmation of Update:** Upon collecting required signatures, the system securely and promptly updates the change.
   

### Acceptance Criteria

####  1. Seamless Adjustment of Signer Thresholds 

   **Objective**: Enable authorized members to update thresholds securely.  

   | Test Case | Description | Relevance |  
   |-----------|-------------|-----------|  
   | `succeed_update_multisig_fuzzy` | Successfully updates thresholds and signer lists with valid proposals. | Ensures flexibility and correct parameter updates.|  
   | `fail_update_multisig_fuzzy` | Blocks threshold updates with invalid permissions (e.g., non-signers attempting changes). | Verifies security invariants for strict administrative controls. |  

   **Key Observations**:  
   - Tests use randomized threshold values (via `--seed` parameter) to validate robustness.  
   - Threshold logic remains intact even under adversarial fuzzing (e.g., invalid quorum values).  

### Security Considerations

- The contract maintains a minimum signer threshold to prevent security
  vulnerabilities.
- Threshold adjustments may be required before certain signer removals to
  maintain contract integrity.
- All the signers are required to sign the contract while initiating the proposal in order to verify the correct signatures (pub-key-hash)
- Single output restriction when updating to prevent double satisfaction attack.

## Contract Termination (validate_end)

### A. Successful Termination

#### Test Case: ```succeed_end_multisig_fuzzy```

   ![succeed_end_multisig_fuzzy.png](/docs/images/succeed_end_multisig_fuzzy.png)


- Objective: Ensure that the contract can be terminated only by properly authorized signers.

- Iterations: 100 tests.

### B. Termination Failure

#### Test Case: Fail Contract Termination (fail_end_multisig_fuzzy)

   ![fail_end_multisig_fuzzy.png](/docs/images/fail_end_multisig_fuzzy.png)

- Objective: Confirm that unauthorized termination attempts are rejected.

- Iterations: 100 tests.

### Technical Highlights  

1. **Property-Based Fuzz Testing:**:  
   - Tests use **Aiken’s fuzz framework** to validate invariants across 100+ randomized inputs per case ensuring that the contract remains robust under both valid and adversarial conditions.

2. **Reproducibility**:  
   - Seed parameters (e.g., --seed=2333146345) allow for deterministic replay of tests, which is essential for debugging and audit trails.

3. **Security Guarantees**:  
   - All tests have consistently passed with no errors or warnings, validating the contract’s stability and security.

   - All administrative actions (updates, removals) require cryptographic authorization.  


## Conclusion

The Upgradable Multisignature Smart Contract demonstrates robust security,
flexibility, and user-centric design. Through thoughtful process implementation and comprehensive testing under a broad spectrum of scenarios, The test results confirm that the contract reliably: 

- **Manages secure spending:** Only authorized transactions are executed.

- **Supports dynamic updates:** Signer thresholds and membership can be updated securely.
- **Terminates safely:** The contract ends only when properly authorized.

These features collectively ensure that the contract can adapt to evolving
organizational needs while maintaining the highest standards of security, flexibility and usability for deployment in evolving organisational environments.
