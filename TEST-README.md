# Upgradable Multi-signature Smart Contract: Test Documentation

## Overview

This document presents comprehensive evidence of the successful implementation
and testing of the Upgradable Multi-signature Smart Contract. It addresses three
key aspects:

1. Secure Spending of Assets
2. Seamless Adjustment of Signer Thresholds
3. Dynamic Addition or Removal of Signers

Each section provides detailed insights into the functionality, security, and
usability of the smart contract.

## Test Suite Details

The test suite for the Upgradable Multisignature Smart Contract consists of eleven
critical test cases, each designed to verify specific aspects of the contract's functionality. Six of these tests are happy path tests whereas five are negative tests.

It incorporates over 1,100 different Aiken property based "fuzzy" tests to generate randomised inputs, allowing us to verify that the on-chain code works correctly under a wide variety of scenarios.

### Test Execution Results

## 1. Secure Spending of Assets

Our rigorous testing suite demonstrates the contract's ability to manage secure
asset spending effectively, starting with the initiating / creation of a multisig

### Detailed Test Analysis

#### A. Test Case: validate_init (succeed_init_multisig_fuzzy)

![init-multisig.png](/docs/images/init-multisig.png)

This test case covers 100 checks to validate the successful initiaition of a multisig smart contract.
It requires the correct datum as per the design specification document as well as all the signers to sign in order for this case to pass.


#### B. Test Case: validate_sign

This test validates the contract's ability to execute transactions when properly
authorized. It demonstrates a successful transaction where:

- Signatories approved the transaction (meeting the threshold)
- The withdrawal amount was within the spending limit
- The contract balance was correctly updated after the transaction

There are three main tests each with 100 different checks within this endpoint:

   1. succeed_sign_lock_multisig_fuzzy

      ![succeed_sign_lock_multisig_fuzzy.png](/docs/images/succeed_sign_lock_multisig_fuzzy.png)

      The test confirms that the contract correctly locks funds in the contract when the required number of signatories approve the transaction.

   1. succeed_sign_unlock_multisig_fuzzy

      ![succeed_sign_unlock_multisig_fuzzy.png](/docs/images/succeed_sign_unlock_multisig_fuzzy.png)

      The test confirms that the contract correctly unlocks funds from the contract when the required number of signatories approve the transaction and the withdrawal amount is within the specified limit.

   1. fail_sign_multisig_fuzzy

      ![fail_sign_multisig_fuzzy.png](/docs/images/fail_sign_multisig_fuzzy.png)

      This test performs 100 different checks demonstrating the robust security measures by successfully rejecting transactions that don't meet the signers requirements and expectations including but not limited to :

      - Insufficient signer threshold
      - Invalid signer inputs
      - Withdrawal amount above spending limit

### Acceptance Criteria

**Objective**: Ensure only authorized members execute asset transactions.  

| Test Case | Description | Relevance |  
|-----------|-------------|-----------|  
| `succeed_sign_unlock_multisig_fuzzy` | Validates that authorized signers can unlock and execute transactions when threshold signatures are provided. | Confirms secure spending logic works under valid conditions. |  
| `succeed_sign_lock_multisig_fuzzy` | Ensures transactions are locked unless the required threshold of valid signatures is met. | Demonstrates enforcement of security rules. |  
| `fail_sign_multisig_fuzzy` | Rejects transactions with invalid/insufficient signatures (e.g., unauthorized signers, incomplete quorum). | Proves unauthorized access is blocked. |  

**Summary**:  
- **100% pass rate** across 100 fuzzy iterations for both valid and invalid scenarios.  
- Fuzz testing simulates adversarial inputs (e.g., malformed signatures, mismatched keys) to stress-test edge cases.

## 2. Seamless and Flexible Contract Updates (validate_update)

The two tests below demonstrate a user-friendly process for verifying the:  

   - Adjusting signer thresholds, ensuring adaptability to changing security needs.
   - Dynamic addition and removal of signers allowing for flexible management of the signer pool, adapting to organizational changes while maintaining security.
   - Secure spending limit adjustment

### Detailed Test Analysis

#### Test Case: Successful Contract Update (succeed_update_multisig_fuzzy)

   ![succeed_update_multisig_fuzzy.png](/docs/images/succeed_update_multisig_fuzzy.png)

This test verifies the contract's ability to adjust the signer threshold without errors, demonstrating the flexibility of the contract's security parameters.

### Update Adjustment Workflow

1. **Initiate Change:** Through an intuitive interface, Signers can: 

   - Propose new threshold values
   - Proposes a new signer, providing necessary credentials
   - Initiate the removal of a specific signer.

2. **Review Proposed Changes:** The system clearly presents current and proposed
   changes for easy comparison.
3. **Collect Required Signatures:** Authorized signers can efficiently review and
   sign the proposal.
4. **Confirmation of Update:** Upon collecting required signatures, the system
   promptly updates the change.


#### Test Case: Fail Contract Update (fail_update_multisig_fuzzy)

   ![fail_update_multisig_fuzzy.png](/docs/images/fail_update_multisig_fuzzy.png)

These fuzzy tests verify the contract's capability to add or remove signers and
adjust the signer threshold, demonstrating its adaptability to changing organizational needs while maintaining security.

### Acceptance Criteria

####  1. Seamless Adjustment of Signer Thresholds 
   **Objective**: Enable authorized members to update thresholds securely.  

   | Test Case | Description | Relevance |  
   |-----------|-------------|-----------|  
   | `succeed_update_multisig_fuzzy` | Validates threshold updates when initiated by authorized signers with valid parameters. | Ensures threshold adjustments work as intended. |  
   | `fail_update_multisig_fuzzy` | Blocks threshold updates with invalid permissions (e.g., non-signers attempting changes). | Verifies security invariants for administrative actions. |  

   **Key Observations**:  
   - Tests use randomized threshold values (via `--seed` parameter) to validate robustness.  
   - Threshold logic remains intact even under adversarial fuzzing (e.g., invalid quorum values).  



#### 2. Dynamic Addition/Removal of Signers  
**Objective**: Dynamically manage signers without compromising security.  

| Test Case | Description | Relevance |  
|-----------|-------------|-----------|  
| `succeed_init_multisig_fuzzy` | Tests multisig initialization with randomized valid signer sets. | Confirms contract bootstraps correctly. |  
| `succeed_remove_multisig_fuzzy` | Validates removal of signers by authorized parties. | Ensures dynamic signer management works. |  
| `fail_init_multisig_fuzzy` | Rejects initialization with invalid parameters (e.g., empty signer list). | Protects against malformed setups. |  

**Testing Rigor**:  
- **Fuzz-driven randomness**: Generates arbitrary signer lists (size, keys) to test edge cases (e.g., 1-of-1, 5-of-10 multisigs).  
- Seed reproducibility (e.g., `--seed=2209211554`) allows deterministic replay of edge cases.  

---


### Security Considerations

- The contract maintains a minimum signer threshold to prevent security
  vulnerabilities.
- Threshold adjustments may be required before certain signer removals to
  maintain contract integrity.
- All the signers are required to sign the contract while initiating the proposal in order to verify the correct signatures (pub-key-hash)
- Single output restriction when updating to prevent double satisfaction attack.

## Contract Termination (validate_end)

### Detailed Test Analysis

#### Test Case: Successful Contract Termination (succeed_end_multisig_fuzzy)

### Technical Highlights  
1. **Property-Based Testing**:  
   - Tests use **Aiken’s fuzz framework** to validate invariants across 100+ randomized inputs per case.  
   - Example: `succeed_end_multisig_fuzzy` ensures multisig termination only succeeds with valid permissions.  

2. **Security Guarantees**:  
   - No test failures observed (`0 failed` in all runs), proving robustness against adversarial inputs.  
   - All administrative actions (updates, removals) require cryptographic authorization.  

3. **Reproducibility**:  
   - Seed values (e.g., `--seed=2333146345`) enable deterministic test replay for audits.

## Conclusion

The Upgradable Multisignature Smart Contract demonstrates robust security,
flexibility, and user-centric design. Through comprehensive testing and
thoughtful process implementation, it effectively manages secure asset spending,
allows for seamless threshold adjustments, and facilitates dynamic signer
management.

These features collectively ensure that the contract can adapt to evolving
organizational needs while maintaining the highest standards of security and
usability.
